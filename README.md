# Setup Instructions

An install script is included to setup all dependencies.

Simply execute the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/hunterwebapps/vimrc.git ~/vimrc && bash ~/vimrc/install.sh`

## Ejecting

You may eject by running the following command.

`bash ~/vimrc/eject.sh`

This copies all configuration and .vim files back to the git directory `~/vimrc`.

Then it will ask whether or not you want to delete the local files from the user's home directory.
